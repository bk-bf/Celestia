## Used to tell the [GaeaRenderer] what to draw in a certain point.
## The result of a Gaea generation is a grid of this resource.
##
## This is an abstract class. On its own, it doesn't do anything,
## but it can be extended to hold data related to the method of rendering
## chosen. See [TileMapMaterial] and [GridMapMaterial].[br]
## It can also be used to hold sub-resources to be chosen programmatically. See [RandomMaterial].
