# Lorekeeper Profession Design Document

## Overview
The Lorekeeper is a dual-purpose support profession that evolves throughout gameplay from an early-game material analyst to a late-game dungeon intelligence expert. This profession creates strategic depth by transforming monster encounters into knowledge resources.

## Core Mechanics

### Analysis System
- **Process**: Designate corpses/materials for analysis → Lorekeeper works at research station → Knowledge produced
- **Analysis Time**: Based on Lorekeeper skill level and material complexity
- **Required Infrastructure**: Basic research station, later upgraded to full library

### Skill Progression
- **Novice**: Basic creature identification, common materials analysis
- **Apprentice**: Territory behavior analysis, basic magical properties detection
- **Expert**: Weakness identification, resource processing methods
- **Master**: Pack size prediction, boss type identification, complex magical interactions
- **Legendary**: Discovery of hidden properties not normally detectable

## Gameplay Functions

### Early Game (Material Analysis)
- Examine monster corpses to reveal species information
- Analyze magical materials to determine properties
- Identify potential uses for unknown resources
- Provide territory intelligence (creature types, dangers, resources)

### Late Game (Dungeon Intelligence)
- Study lore items (scrolls, books, artifacts)
- Create expedition plans for dungeon raids
- Identify potential curses and dangers
- Compile knowledge into strategic intelligence

## Integration with Other Systems

### Monster Territory System
- Reveals resource distribution within territories
- Provides intelligence on creature strength and numbers
- Suggests optimal approaches for territory conquest

### Crafting System
- Discovers optimal processing methods for materials
- Identifies potential uses for mysterious substances
- Reveals synergies between different material types

### Research System
- Analysis contributes to technological advancement
- Knowledge transfer between master and apprentice Lorekeepers
- Occasional unexpected research insights from analysis

## Strategic Decision Points
- Analysis vs. Processing: Use materials immediately or analyze for information
- Exploration Priorities: Target territories based on Lorekeeper intelligence
- Pawn Development: Balance Lorekeeper training with other professions

## Visual Design
- **Workstation**: Detailed bench with alchemical equipment, magnifying glasses, reference books
- **Work Animation**: Examining specimens with various tools
- **Knowledge Products**: Distinct books, scrolls, or diagrams

## UI Elements
- Analysis queue interface
- Knowledge repository/library catalog
- Territory intelligence overlay

## Balance Considerations
- Analysis time vs. information value
- Resource investment in Lorekeeper infrastructure
- Knowledge advantage vs. immediate resource needs

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Specialized Lorekeeper subtypes (monster specialist, material specialist) (?)
- Lorekeeper-specific quests and events
- Advanced analysis techniques unlocked through research
