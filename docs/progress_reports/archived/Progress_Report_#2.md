# Celestia Development Progress Report

## Systems Implemented

### 1. Monster Territory System

- Successfully implemented a territory system using FastNoiseLite for procedural generation
- Created a TerritoryDatabase with four monster territory types (wolf_pack, bear_den, goblin_tribe, drake_nest)
- Implemented territory preferences based on terrain types (forest, mountain, swamp)
- Added territory visualization with color coding for different monster territories
- Terrain-based territory assignment with avoidance of water/river tiles
- Implemented territory coverage statistics tracking


### 2. Terrain Generation System

- Completed base terrain generation using FastNoiseLite
- Implemented noise normalization to create consistent terrain distribution
- Added terrain thresholds for proper biome assignment
- Created terrain visualization with color mapping from terrain database
- Implemented subterrain variations for visual diversity


### 3. Data Structure Implementation

- Completed MapData, Tile, and Grid classes for storing world information
- Implemented a coordinate system for mapping and accessing tiles
- Created a NoiseGenerator class to centralize noise generation
- Successfully implemented serialization for map data


## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Territory Assignment Issues

- Fixed critical timing issue where territory was being assigned before terrain generation was complete
- Identified and fixed synchronization bug where tiles reported different terrain types at different stages
- Resolved territory owner property assignment issues
- Fixed preferred terrain matching by ensuring proper timing in the generation pipeline
- Properly integrated territory post-processing to enforce terrain preferences


### 2. Performance Optimization

- Identified performance issues with large maps (800Ã—800)
- Researched chunking systems for future implementation
- Developed a plan for view distance implementation for pawns
- Discussed portal system as a solution to maintain separate map areas


### 3. Technical Debugging

- Resolved issues with print statements not showing during territory generation
- Fixed parameter mismatch between territory database and territory assignment
- Corrected array vs string comparison issues in terrain preference checking
- Implemented debugging techniques to trace territory assignment issues


## Design Decisions

### 1. Portal System

- Designed concept for portals at monster territory centers
- Planned implementation of separate maps for special locations (caves, bandit hideouts)
- Identified technical approach for scene transitions between map areas
- Created plan for pawn selection across different map scenes


### 2. Performance Strategy

- Decided on view distance implementation for pawns to improve performance
- Planned chunking system implementation for large maps
- Explored refactoring and profiling integration into development cycle


## Current Status

- Monster Territory System fully operational with terrain-based assignment
- Basic terrain generation complete with river systems
- Visualization of both terrain and territories functioning correctly
- Multiple territory types generating in appropriate terrain areas
- Reproducible terrain generation with seed-based randomization
- Statistics tracking for territory coverage and terrain distribution


## Next Steps Prioritized

1. Implement pathfinding using existing Tile.walkable property
2. Add resource generation focusing on 2-3 main resources
3. Implement pawn movement with terrain movement multipliers
4. Begin exploration of portal system for territory centers
5. Implement basic profiling to establish performance baseline
6. Begin optimization for larger maps

This progress represents a significant advancement of the project roadmap, with several MVP tasks completed ahead of schedule. The Monster Territory System implementation represents one of the core distinctive features mentioned in the project overview.
