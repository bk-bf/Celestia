# Celestia Progress Report: Resource Generation System Implementation

## May 2025

This report summarizes the development progress on the Resource Generation System for Celestia, focusing on implementation details, technical decisions, and challenges overcome during this development phase.

## Systems Implemented - Resource Generation System

- Successfully implemented a separate ResourceGenerator class following the established architectural pattern
- Created a comprehensive ResourceDatabase with three initial resources:
    - Wood (associated with forest terrain, particularly "tree" subterrain)
    - Stone (associated with mountain terrain, specifically "rocky" and "cliff" subterrains)
    - Herbs (associated with plains and forest terrains, focused on "flower_field", "moss", and "deep_grass" subterrains)
- Integrated the resource generation with the existing noise system to create natural-looking resource distributions
- Made resource spawning deterministic and seed-based, ensuring reproducible worlds
- Modified the Tile class to properly handle multiple resource types with varying amounts
- Implemented resource visualization on the map with unique colors for each resource type
- Added resource density variation based on noise values, creating realistic clusters


## Challenges Overcome - Resource Implementation Issues

- Addressed initial integration issues with the NoiseGenerator, opting to use the existing detail noise tier instead of creating a new generator
- Resolved terrain subtype naming inconsistencies, ensuring proper matching between terrain subtypes and resource requirements
- Fixed resource placement logic to ensure resources spawn exclusively on their corresponding subterrain types
- Solved initial imbalance issues where wood generated extensively but stone and herbs did not spawn
- Improved the MapRenderer with a modular approach to handle multiple visualization features
- Addressed font rendering performance issues in debug visualization by implementing zoom-based rendering thresholds


## Design Decisions - Resource System Architecture

- Adopted a separate ResourceGenerator approach rather than embedding resource generation within terrain generation for better modularity and future expansion
- Designed the resource system to support future growth for planned resources
- Removed the initially proposed resource_revealed property in favor of the planned pawn vision range system
- Implemented resource statistics tracking in the existing MapStatistics system
- Made resource frequency values configurable, allowing easy balancing of resource abundance
- Implemented subterrain-specific resource generation to create logical connection between visible terrain features and available resources


## Technical Improvements - Code Organization

- Refactored the monolithic `_draw()` function into smaller, specialized functions for better maintainability
- Created a dedicated MapRenderer utility class to separate rendering logic from game logic
- Implemented toggle functions for all visualization features
- Added resource statistics to the map statistics system
- Improved resource distribution visualization and balancing tools
- Implemented synchronization between the map generator and renderer settings


## Current Status

- Resource generation system fully operational with three initial resources (wood, stone, herbs)
- Visual indicators for resources implemented and working
- Resource statistics tracking integrated with existing statistics system
- Fully seed-based generation ensuring reproducible worlds
- Resource balancing tools in place for future fine-tuning
- Tile debug statistics (containing fonts) are experiencing rendering issues, might need redisign soon

## Next Steps Prioritized

1. Implement simple resource harvesting mechanics
2. Develop pawn movement with terrain movement multipliers
3. Begin implementation of basic pawn class with core attributes
4. Implement basic inventory system for resource storage
5. Design job system for resource collection
6. Expand resource types based on gameplay testing feedback
