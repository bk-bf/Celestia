# Celestia Progress Report: Resource Harvesting Implementation

May 2025

This report summarizes the development progress on implementing the resource harvesting mechanics for Celestia, focusing on implementation details, technical decisions, and challenges overcome during this development phase.

## Systems Implemented

### 1. Resource Harvesting Mechanics

- Successfully implemented a state machine-based approach for pawn behaviors (Idle, MovingToResource, Harvesting)
- Created a HarvestingJob class to track harvesting progress and resource information
- Implemented visual feedback for harvesting with progress bars
- Added inventory system for pawns to store harvested resources
- Integrated resource harvesting with the existing movement and pathfinding systems
- Implemented proper resource removal from map tiles after harvesting


### 2. State Machine Architecture

- Designed and implemented a flexible PawnStateMachine class
- Created base PawnState class with enter(), exit(), and update() methods
- Implemented concrete states for different pawn behaviors
- Added state transitions based on pawn status and player commands
- Ensured proper separation of concerns between states


### 3. Input Handling Improvements

- Enhanced InputHandler to support resource harvesting commands
- Implemented middle-mouse click for resource harvesting
- Added proper tile selection and resource detection
- Created visual feedback for resource selection


### 4. Inventory Management

- Implemented basic inventory system for pawns to store resources
- Added carrying capacity calculations based on pawn strength
- Created methods for adding and removing resources from inventory
- Implemented weight tracking for carried resources


## Technical Challenges Overcome

### 1. Resource Access Architecture

- Resolved complex referencing issues with MapData by implementing a MapDataManager singleton
- Created proper autoload configuration for global resource access
- Fixed inconsistencies between different resource access methods
- Standardized resource access patterns across the codebase


### 2. State Machine Debugging

- Identified and fixed issues with state transitions not occurring properly
- Implemented comprehensive debug logging for state machine operations
- Added visual indicators for current pawn states
- Created performance-conscious debugging with throttled log messages


### 3. Sprite Rendering Issues

- Resolved critical issues with pawn sprites not rendering
- Implemented a dedicated SpriteRenderer to handle visual representation
- Fixed z-indexing to ensure pawns render above terrain
- Added visual feedback for selected pawns and harvesting operations


### 4. Resource System Integration

- Addressed disconnects between ResourceDatabase and Tile resource storage
- Fixed resource detection and access in harvesting code
- Implemented proper resource reduction when harvested
- Ensured consistent resource representation across systems


## Design Decisions

### 1. State Machine Architecture

- Adopted a modular state machine approach for pawn behaviors to improve code organization
- Created a clear separation between movement, resource harvesting, and idle behaviors
- Implemented state-specific methods for entering, exiting, and updating states
- Designed for extensibility to support future pawn behaviors


### 2. Resource Access Strategy

- Implemented a singleton pattern for MapData access to resolve reference issues
- Created a consistent interface for accessing resources across different systems
- Standardized on the Dictionary-based approach for storing resources in tiles
- Designed resource harvesting to work with the existing resource generation system


### 3. Harvesting Mechanics

- Implemented a job-based approach to resource harvesting
- Created a progress-based system for harvesting time
- Designed harvesting to be interruptible for higher-priority tasks
- Integrated harvesting with the existing movement system for a seamless experience


## Current Status

- Resource harvesting system operational with proper state transitions
- Pawns can successfully move to resources and harvest them
- Resources are properly removed from the map after harvesting
- Harvested resources are added to pawn inventories
- Visual feedback for harvesting progress is implemented


## Next Steps Prioritized

1. Complete remaining polish tasks for resource harvesting
2. Implement simple trait system for pawn personality
3. Add basic pawn appearance generation
4. Implement pawn naming system
5. Begin work on pawn needs system

This progress represents a significant advancement in the project roadmap, completing the "Simple resource harvesting mechanics" milestone in Phase 3 of the development plan. The implementation aligns with the project's design philosophy of prioritizing feature completion and gameplay iteration over advanced optimization.
