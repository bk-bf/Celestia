# Progress Report for Celestia Development

## Completed Tasks

### Pawn System Implementation

- Created a basic Pawn class with core attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence)
- Implemented attribute effects on gameplay mechanics (movement speed, carrying capacity)
- Added visual representation for pawns on the map
- Integrated pawns with the existing terrain system for movement costs


### Input Handling System

- Created a dedicated InputHandler as a Node2D to manage player interactions
- Implemented pawn selection with left-click
- Implemented movement commands with right-click
- Added visual feedback for selected pawns


### Pathfinding Integration

- Connected the existing pathfinding system to pawn movement
- Implemented terrain-aware movement with different speeds based on terrain type
- Added debug visualization for paths (with performance toggle)
- Ensured pawns only move to walkable tiles


### Architecture Improvements

- Established a proper Main scene as the game's entry point
- Created a PawnManager to handle pawn creation and tracking
- Integrated the pawn system with existing MapData and TerrainDatabase
- Implemented proper coordinate conversion between screen and grid spaces


## Technical Challenges Overcome

- Resolved input handling conflicts between different nodes
- Fixed coordinate conversion issues between screen and grid spaces
- Addressed performance issues with path visualization by implementing a toggle
- Ensured proper integration between the pawn system and existing terrain movement costs


## Current State

- Pawns spawn in the center of the map
- Players can select pawns with left-click
- Selected pawns can be moved to walkable locations with right-click
- Pawns move at different speeds based on terrain type
- Path visualization is available but toggled off by default due to performance impact


## Next Steps

According to your roadmap, the logical next steps would be:

- Expand the pawn system with additional attributes and traits
- Implement the needs system for pawns
- Develop work priorities and AI behaviors
- Begin implementing the social interaction system

The foundation you've built with the core pawn system and movement mechanics provides a solid base for these more complex features.
