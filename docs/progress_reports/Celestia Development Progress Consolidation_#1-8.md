# Celestia Development Progress Consolidation

## Core Systems Implemented

**Terrain \& World Generation System**

**Resource Harvesting**

- Implemented state machine for pawn behaviors (Idle, MovingToResource, Harvesting, Eating, Sleeping)
- Created HarvestingJob class to track progress and resource information
- Added visual feedback with progress bars for harvesting
- Implemented inventory system for pawns to store harvested resources
- Integrated resource harvesting with movement and pathfinding
- Enhanced resource system with skill requirements

**UI System**

- Established UI structure with CanvasLayer, Control nodes, and proper anchoring
- Implemented BottomMenuBar for navigation and PawnMenuBar for selected pawns
- Created PawnInfoPanel showing name, attributes, and job status
- Enhanced InputHandler to detect UI elements and prevent game actions when clicking UI
- Connected pawn jobs to UI through signal-based architecture
- Added HUD panel with anchor points
- Implemented HUD framework and adjusted window settings
- Added work priority management system

**Sprite and TileMap Implementation**

- Refactored visualization to use TileMaps instead of sprites for efficiency
- Implemented TileMap-based rendering for terrain display
- Created basic placeholder sprites for terrain types and resources
- Implemented proper z-indexing for entities and terrain layers
- Added sprite-based visualization for resources and pawns
- Designed visual feedback for selected pawns and active jobs


## Technical Achievements \& Architecture

**Data Structure Implementation**

- Completed MapData, Tile, and Grid classes for storing world information
- Implemented coordinate system for map access
- Created NoiseGenerator to centralize noise generation
- Successfully implemented serialization for map data
- Established MapDataManager singleton for consistent resource access
- Enhanced grid with cell size management and coordinate conversion methods
- Refactored map data initialization for pawn loading safety

**Database Management**

- Consolidated every database (Terrain, Territory, Resource, etc.) in a DatabaseManager singleton
- Created streamlined access across other scripts through the singleton pattern
- Implemented proper autoload configuration for global resource access
- Standardized data access patterns across the codebase
- Completed comprehensive DatabaseManager implementation

**Input Handling System**

- Created dedicated InputHandler for player interactions
- Implemented pawn selection with left-click and movement with right-click
- Added middle-mouse click for resource harvesting
- Fixed input handling conflicts between different nodes
- Prevented pawn deselection when clicking on UI elements
- Enhanced camera input configurations

**Map Rendering**

- Refactored map rendering into dedicated renderer class
- Updated map rendering and font mipmap settings
- Enhanced visualization techniques for debugging
- Added map center utilities
- Implemented statistics generation and tracking


## Challenges Overcome

**Territory \& Generation Issues**

- Fixed timing issues where territory was assigned before terrain generation
- Resolved synchronization bugs with terrain type reporting
- Fixed territory owner property assignment
- Identified performance issues with large maps (800×800)
- Balanced terrain distribution for interesting world generation
- Resolved a bug where territories would not adhere to no-water/preferred terrain rules

**Pathfinding \& Movement**

- Limited maximum tiles checks to handle 200×200 maps efficiently
- Implemented performance safeguards to prevent game freezes
- Resolved path visualization performance impact with toggle feature
- Fixed coordinate conversion between screen and grid spaces
- Enhanced grid handling and movement costs

**Resource System Integration**

- Addressed disconnects between ResourceDatabase and Tile resource storage
- Fixed resource detection and access in harvesting code
- Standardized resource access patterns across codebase
- Resolved complex referencing issues with MapData
- Enhanced resource system with skill requirements

**UI \& Input Challenges**

- Fixed signal connection issues with UI elements
- Resolved issues with InputHandler consuming all events
- Created proper state management for UI panels
- Fixed problems with content organization and visibility
- Improved job signaling system


## Current Status

- Core systems operational: terrain generation, monster territories, pathfinding, pawns, resource harvesting, and UI
- Architecture foundation solid with proper data structures and organization
- Pawns can move with terrain awareness, be selected, and harvest resources
- Visualization tools implemented for debugging and development
- UI system provides information display and navigation options
- Pawn needs system implemented with hunger, rest states, and mood tracking
- Work priority management system in place


## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining polish for resource harvesting system
2. Implement pawn traits, appearance generation, and naming system
3. Expand the UI with additional panels (Equipment, Needs, Health, Log, Social)
4. Implement basic profiling for performance baseline
5. Begin exploration of portal system for territory centers
6. Enhance monster territory system with difficulty gradients
7. Further develop the designation system for construction and zoning
8. Expand work priorities and AI behaviors

This consolidation represents the development progress of Celestia, a fantasy colony simulation game with procedural generation, monster territories, and resource management as its core gameplay systems.
